## Proposal
The website I chose is the one I created for my HTML project for the business 'Glass Expression', a glass art studio that sells glass arts,glassworking tools, and supplies.

### My Proposal :

1. I would like to implement form validation using javascript in the contact form of the website.Form validation is required to validate the user input in forms, ensuring that the data is entered and that it is in the correct format.
2. After submitting the contact form, I want a popup box to appear to show the message has been successfully sent.
3. Modal Images: On the supplies page, there are some images of the products, like stained glass kits and stained glass grinders. I would like to make those images larger when clicked on without having to leave the page, so the user gets a better viewing experience of the products.
